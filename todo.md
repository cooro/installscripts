# TODO
1. Script for installing all the dependencies needed to support the configurations in my dotfiles.
2. Script for pulling down all the git repositories I need.
    * Special attention needs to be paid to the `dotfiles` repository. It's a git bare repo, so it needs to be integrated in a multi-step process.
