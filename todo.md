# TODO
1. Script for installing all the dependencies needed to support the configurations in my dotfiles.
    Running List of Programs:
    * yay
    * git
    * networkmanager
    * xmonad-git
    * xmonad-contrib-git
    * xmobar
    * alacritty
    * picom
    * dmenu
    * pcmanfm
    * lxsession
    * nitrogen
    * trayer
    * dunst
    * network-manager-applet
    * volumeicon
2. Script for pulling down all the git repositories I need.
    * Special attention needs to be paid to the `dotfiles` repository. It's a git bare repo, so it needs to be integrated in a multi-step process.
    * Integrating the `yay-updates.sh` script for xmobar will require installing some files in system directories. In particular, a systemd timer needs to be set up to make the script work properly.
3. Script that installs the general packages I consider to be always needed for a working system.
    Running list of Programs:
    * discord
    * firefox
    * steam
    * java
    * libreoffice
    * gimp
    * mpv
    * feh
